```{r}

# colnames(d)

subset(d, select = columns_to_analyse)
nrows <- nrow(d)
# remove the metadata

d <- d[3:nrows,]
d <- d[d$StartDate >= "2022-04-06 14:33:20"]

There are `r nrows` in this analysis.

```{r}
hist(as.numeric(d$Duration..in.seconds))
```
### Covariate balance checks



```{r, include=FALSE}
d$assignment_to_treatment <-  ifelse(d$Age.1 == "", 0, 1)
d$gender_aggregated <- ifelse(d$assignment_to_treatment == 1, 
                              d$Gender.1, d$Gender)
d$investing_knowledge_aggregated <- ifelse(d$assignment_to_treatment == 1, 
                                           d$Investing.knowledge.1, d$Investing.knowledge)
d$age_aggregated <- ifelse(d$assignment_to_treatment == 1, 
                           d$Age.1, d$Age)
d$education_aggregated <- ifelse(d$assignment_to_treatment == 1, 
                           d$Education.1, d$Education)
d$household_income_aggregated <- ifelse(d$assignment_to_treatment == 1, 
                           d$Household.income.1, d$Household.income)
d$ethnicity_aggregated <- ifelse(d$assignment_to_treatment == 1, 
                           d$Ethnicity.1, d$Ethnicity)
d$stock_aggregated <- ifelse(d$assignment_to_treatment == 1, 
                           d$Stock_1.1, d$Stock_1)
```

### Covariate Balance Checks

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Gender
ggplot(d, aes(x = assignment_to_treatment, fill = gender_aggregated)) +
  geom_bar()

# Investing Knowledge
ggplot(d, aes(x = assignment_to_treatment, fill = investing_knowledge_aggregated)) +
  geom_bar()

# Age
ggplot(d, aes(x = assignment_to_treatment, fill = age_aggregated)) +
  geom_bar()

# Education
ggplot(d, aes(x = assignment_to_treatment, fill = education_aggregated)) +
  geom_bar()

# Household Income
ggplot(d, aes(x = assignment_to_treatment, fill = household_income_aggregated)) +
  geom_bar()

# Ethnicity
ggplot(d, aes(x = assignment_to_treatment, fill = ethnicity_aggregated)) +
  geom_bar()
```
It looks pretty balanced.

### Average Treatment Effect Estimate

```{r}
control <- as.numeric(d[d$assignment_to_treatment == 0]$stock_aggregated)
treatment <- as.numeric(d[d$assignment_to_treatment == 1]$stock_aggregated)

treatment_mean <- mean(treatment)
control_mean <- mean(na.omit(control))

ate <- (treatment_mean - control_mean) / control_mean

t.test(control, treatment)
```

There is a 6% decrease in the likelihood of investing in a stock given the low ESG score (3.8/10) in the treatment.
